# Morpheus
This is a project for a Computer Graphics class. Its goal is to create a simple 3D graphics engine.

## Naming
I chose that name, because Morpheus is a Ancient Greek god associated with dreams. And as dreams are a projection of our
sleeping mind, so will this project aim to create a projection of a 3D scene on the screen.

## Phases
As it is a project for a class, it's separated into three assignments, and as such will it be divided into three phases.

### Arche
The begining, just a simple engine capable o of projecting 3D points onto the screen, with a movable camera.
